# Xilinx-PMOD-Grove-Adapter

I wanted to try [Xilinx PYNQ Workshop](github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ_Workshop) in order to run HLS code on the FPGA fabric of the Zynq 7020 SoC. However, the workshop relies on [Grove](https://wiki.sipeed.com/soft/maixpy/en/modules/grove/index.html)-type sensors. 
There used to be a PMOD to Grove adapter board, but it is not for sale anymore. That is why I decided to make my own PMOD to Grove adapter board that has been tested and used for the PYNQ-Z2 board, but should work with other boards as well.

# Bill of Material (BOM)

The most widely available option is AliExpress, that is where I ordered the components. The PCBs are ordered at JLCPCB.
